        A year ago, I graduated Georgia State University with a degree in 
        Criminal Justice and I have been trying to acquire skills in coding 
        which lead me to this boot camp. I am currently taking a boot camp at the Clubhouse, 
        and learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because I want to combine the skills that I learned with my degree in Criminal Justice 
        to get a good government job.With the coding skills and my degree in 
        Criminal Justice to work for a government agency like Georgia Bureau of Investigation for example.

          Xbox wishlist
         This is an app I created that shows all of xbox games that I want. Once I put the name of the game in the alert will say this game is checked. If the game that is put in is not on the list then It says not on the list.

        For technologies I used Html and within it I used  href and scripts to link the the javascript and CSS. I also used list, Ids, input types, created href links to GitHub and Amazon, and I used img scr to pull url images for the web. In CSS I id certain areas to add color, fonts, borders, and a background image to the web page. In JavaScript I used console log, variables, if statements, functions, event listeners and for loops.
