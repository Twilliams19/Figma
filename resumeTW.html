    <p class="box1">
        A year ago, I graduated Georgia State University with a degree in Criminal Justice and I have been trying to acquire skills in coding which lead me to this boot camp.

        I am currently taking a boot camp at the Clubhouse, and learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because I want to combine the skills that I learned with my degree in Criminal Justice to get a good government job.
        
        With the coding skills and my degree in Criminal Justice to work for a government agency like Georgia Bureau of Investigation for example.
