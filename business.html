<h1 id="go">About Taylor Williams</h1>
<p>
In 2018, I graduated Georgia State University with a degree in Criminal Justice and I have been trying to acquire skills in coding which lead me to this boot camp.
</p>
<h1 id="go">What I am Doing Now</h1>
<p>I am currently taking a boot camp at the Clubhouse, and learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, because I want to combine the skills that I learned with my degree in Criminal Justice to get a good government job.
    </p>
<h1 id="go">Future Plans</h1>
<p>With the coding skills and my degree in Criminal Justice I hope to work for a government agency like Georgia Bureau of Investigation as one example.</p>

<h1 id="go">My Project</h1>
<ol>
<li> The name of my project is Xbox wishlist</li>
<li>This is an app I created that shows all of xbox games that I want. Once I put the name of the game in the alert will say this game is checked. If the game that is put in is not on the list then It says not on the list.</li>
<li><a href="https://twilliams19.github.io/Myapp/TaylorApp.html">Click for Project</a></li>
<li> The technologies that I used was Html and within it I used  href and scripts to link the the javascript and CSS together. I also used list, Ids, input types, created href links to GitHub and Amazon, and I used img scr to pull url images for the web. In CSS I used id in certain areas to add color, fonts, borders, and a background image to the web page. In JavaScript I used console log, variables, if statements, functions, event listeners and for loops.</li>
 </ol>
